# PathFinding Visualizer
A react-based algorithms visualizer, built without any UI library. You can view live [here](https://suaebahmed.github.io/algorithms-visualizer/).

# 1. Path Finding

## Concepts
Each grid cell represents a node in a implicit graph.
  - Each node has 4 adjacent node
  - The distance between adjecent node is 1 unit

## Features
- [x] Search algorithms
  - [x] Depth-First Search
  - [x] Breadth-First Search
  - [x] A\* Search
  - [x] Dijkstra
  
- [x] Pattern generation algorithms
  - [x] Basic random
  - [x] Randomized DFS
  - [x] Recursive division
  - [ ] Kruskal's Algorithm
  - [ ] Prim's Algorithm

- [x] Draw your own wall nodes with mouse
- [x] Drag and drop the source and target nodes
- [x] Control animation speed


## Installation

```bash
# To install all dependencies of the project.
> npm install

# To run the app on http://localhost:3000.
> npm run start

# To build the bundled app for production on the `build` folder.
> npm run build
> npm run deploy
```
### Acknowledge

I took inspirations from the few sources for some of the segments.

## What I have revised/learnt by doing this project
  1. implementing algorithm to visualize
  2. initialize each cell to object/class
  3. JS Promise to run animation asyncronusly
  4. array destructure (usestate hooks)
  5. reference and copy variable
  6. difference between == and === .For example "false===0" it's false
  7. For only use React state/useState to re-render dom-elememt. 
  otherwise use global variable to access from all corner
  8. writing re-useable code
